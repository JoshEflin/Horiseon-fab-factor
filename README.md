# accessibility-refactor-horiseon


## Description
This is a refactoring project for practicing proper use of semantic elements in HTML as well as DRY CSS coding.  In this code there is no Javascript and the page is not programmed to be responsive to different screen sizes.  The goal was to take pre existing code, and clean it.
